# Spirit of Goa
GiveGoa is an NLP-based project carried out for our groups client - ActForGoa, aimed at understanding how people perceive the true spirit of Goa. Through survey responses and Reddit discussions, we explored what defines Goaâ€™s unique identity using sentiment analysis and topic modeling. The project highlights key cultural and emotional themes that reflect how Goa is experienced and valued by its people.
